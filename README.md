# ft_printf

ft_printf is a custom implementation of the printf function in the C programming language, developed as part of the 42 school curriculum. It provides a versatile and flexible way to format and output text, similar to the standard printf function. The project demonstrates string manipulation, variable argument handling, and formatting capabilities.

The primary objective of ft_printf is to recreate the functionality of the printf function, allowing users to output formatted text with various placeholders and formatting options. It provides a comprehensive set of format specifiers to handle different data types and formatting requirements.

## Key Features:

- Format specifiers: ft_printf supports a wide range of format specifiers, such as %d for integers, %s for strings, %c for characters, and many more.
- Variable arguments: The function handles variable arguments, allowing users to pass a variable number of arguments that correspond to the format specifiers.
- Precision and width: ft_printf provides options to specify the precision and width of the output, enabling precise control over formatting.
- Flags and modifiers: The function supports flags and modifiers, such as padding, alignment, and conversion modifiers, to tailor the output to specific requirements.
- Customizability: ft_printf allows for easy extensibility, enabling users to add their own custom format specifiers or modifiers.

By working on ft_printf, you will gain a deeper understanding of string manipulation, formatting techniques, and variable argument handling. It provides a practical exercise in implementing a widely used function, helping you enhance your programming skills and understanding of the intricacies of printf-like functionality.

**Note:** This project was developed as part of the 42 school curriculum and should be considered a learning exercise rather than a fully-featured printf implementation for production use.
